# Artificial Intelligence [Java 17+]

"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, 
as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. 
Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": 
any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize 
its chance of achieving its goals."
